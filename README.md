# storypug

Storypug makes it easy and more natural to use [pug](https://pugjs.org) templates in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) (and, incidentally, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/))

In a nutshell storypug let's you import [pug mixins](https://pugjs.org/language/mixins.html) as compiled functions and render them to HTML with options.

## Installation

You need to install both pug and pug-runtime alongside storypug.

```sh
npm i pug pug-runtime storypug
```

## Usage

### Storybook configuration
